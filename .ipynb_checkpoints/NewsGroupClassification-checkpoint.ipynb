       "'introduction atheism article attempts provide general introduction atheism. whilst tried neutral possible regarding contentious issues, always remember document represents one viewpoint. would encourage read widely draw conclusions relevant books listed companion article. provide sense cohesion progression, presented article imaginary conversation atheist theist. questions asked imaginary theist questions cropped repeatedly alt.atheism since newsgroup created. frequently asked questions answered companion article. please note article arguably slanted towards answering questions posed christian viewpoint. faq files reflect questions actually asked, predominantly christians proselytize alt.atheism. talk religion, talking primarily religions christianity, judaism islam, involve sort superhuman divine being. much discussion apply religions, may not. what atheism atheism characterized absence belief existence god. atheists go further, believe god exist. former often referred weak atheist position, latter strong atheism. important note difference two positions. weak atheism simple scepticism disbelief existence god. strong atheism positive belief god exist. please fall trap assuming atheists strong atheists. atheists believe nonexistence gods others limit atheism specific gods, christian god, rather making flatout denials. but disbelieving god thing believing exist definitely not. disbelief proposition means one believe true. believing something true equivalent believing false one may simply idea whether true not. brings us agnosticism. what agnosticism then term agnosticism coined professor huxley meeting metaphysical society 1876. defined agnostic someone disclaimed strong atheism believed ultimate origin things must cause unknown unknowable. thus agnostic someone believes cannot know sure whether god exists. words slippery things, language inexact. beware assuming work someones philosophical point view simply fact calls atheist agnostic. example, many people use agnosticism mean weak atheism, use word atheism referring strong atheism. beware also word atheist many shades meaning, difficult generalize atheists. say sure atheists believe god. example, certainly case atheists believe science best way find universe. so philosophical justification basis atheism many philosophical justifications atheism. find particular person chooses atheist, best ask her. many atheists feel idea god presented major religions essentially selfcontradictory, logically impossible god could exist. others atheists scepticism, see evidence god exists. but impossible prove nonexistence something many counterexamples statement. example, quite simple prove exist prime number larger prime numbers. course, deals welldefined objects obeying welldefined rules. whether gods universes similarly welldefined matter debate. however, assuming moment existence god provably impossible, still subtle reasons assuming nonexistence god. assume something exist, always possible show assumption invalid finding single counterexample. hand assume something exist, thing question provably impossible, showing assumption invalid may require exhaustive search possible places thing might found, show there. exhaustive search often impractical impossible. problem largest primes, prove exist. therefore generally accepted must assume things exist unless evidence do. even theists follow rule time believe unicorns, even though cant conclusively prove unicorns exist anywhere. assume god exists make assumption probably cannot tested. cannot make exhaustive search everywhere god might prove exist anywhere. sceptical atheist assumes default god exist, since assumption test. profess strong atheism usually claim sort god exists instead, generally restrict claims cover varieties god described followers various religions. whilst may impossible prove conclusively god exists, may possible prove say god described particular religious book exist. may even possible prove god described presentday religion exists. practice, believing god described religion exists close believing god exists. however, sufficiently different counterarguments based impossibility disproving every kind god really applicable. but god essentially nondetectable god interacts universe way, effects interaction must measurable. hence interaction universe must detectable. god essentially nondetectable, must therefore case interact universe way. many atheists would argue god interact universe all, importance whether exists not. bible believed, god easily detectable israelites. surely still detectable today note demanding god interact scientifically verifiable, physical way. must surely possible perceive effect caused presence, though otherwise, distinguish things exist ok, may think theres philosophical justification atheism, still religious belief one common pastimes philosophical discussion the redefinition game. cynical view game follows person begins making contentious statement. person b points cant true, person gradually redefines words used statement arrives something person b prepared accept. records statement, along fact person b agreed it, continues. eventually uses statement agreed fact, uses original definitions words rather obscure redefinitions originally needed get b agree it. rather seen apparently inconsistent, b tend play along. point digression answer question isnt atheism religious belief depends crucially upon meant religious. religion generally characterized belief superhuman controlling power  especially sort god  faith worship.  worth pointing passing varieties buddhism religion according definition.  atheism certainly belief sort superhuman power, categorized worship meaningful sense. widening definition religious encompass atheism tends result many aspects human behaviour suddenly becoming classed religious well  science, politics, watching tv. ok, religion. surely belief atheism or science still act faith, like religion is firstly, entirely clear sceptical atheism something one actually believes in. secondly, necessary adopt number core beliefs assumptions make sort sense sensory data experience. atheists try adopt core beliefs possible even subject questioning experience throws doubt. science number core assumptions. example, generally assumed laws physics observers. sort core assumptions atheists make. basic ideas called acts faith, almost everything know must said based acts faith, term loses meaning. faith often used refer complete, certain belief something. according definition, atheism science certainly acts faith. course, individual atheists scientists dogmatic religious followers claiming something certain. general tendency, however many atheists would reluctant state certainty universe exists. faith also used refer belief without supporting evidence proof. sceptical atheism certainly fit definition, sceptical atheism beliefs. strong atheism closer, still really match, even dogmatic atheist tend refer experimental data or lack it asserting god exist. if atheism religious, surely antireligious unfortunate human tendency label everyone either for against, friend enemy. truth clearcut. atheism position runs logically counter theism sense, said antireligion. however, religious believers speak atheists antireligious usually mean atheists sort antipathy hatred towards theists. categorization atheists hostile towards religion quite unfair. atheist attitudes towards theists fact cover broad spectrum. atheists take live let live attitude. unless questioned, usually mention atheism, except perhaps close friends. course, may part atheism socially acceptable many countries. atheists quite antireligious, may even try convert others possible. historically, antireligious atheists made little impact society outside eastern bloc countries. to digress slightly soviet union originally dedicated separation church state, like usa. soviet citizens legally free worship wished. institution state atheism came stalin took control soviet union tried destroy churches order gain complete power population. atheists quite vocal beliefs, see religion encroaching matters business  example, government usa. individuals usually concerned church state remain separate. but allow religion say running state, surely thats state atheism principle separation church state state shall legislate concerning matters religious belief. particular, means state cannot promote one religion expense another, also cannot promote belief religious nature. religions still say discussion purely secular matters. example, religious believers historically responsible encouraging many political reforms. even today, many organizations campaigning increase spending foreign aid founded religious campaigns. long campaign concerning secular matters, long discriminate religious grounds, atheists quite happy see say. what prayer schools theres god, care people pray people pray voters lawmakers, tend things pray cant ignore. also, christian prayer schools intimidating nonchristians, even told need join in. diversity religious nonreligious belief means impossible formulate meaningful prayer acceptable present public event. also, nonprayers tend friends family pray. reasonable care friends family wasting time, even without motives. you mentioned christians campaign increased foreign aid. atheists atheist charities hospitals atheists object religious charities many charities without religious purpose atheists contribute to. atheists contribute religious charities well, sake practical good do. atheists even voluntary work charities founded theistic basis. atheists seem feel atheism worth shouting connection charity. them, atheism simple, obvious everyday matter, charity. many feel somewhat cheap, say selfrighteous, use simple charity excuse plug particular set religious beliefs. weak atheists, building hospital say i believe god rather strange idea rather like holding party say today birthday. fuss atheism rarely evangelical. you said atheism antireligious. perhaps backlash ones upbringing, way rebelling perhaps is, some. many people parents attempt force religious or atheist ideas upon them, many people choose call atheists. also doubtless case religious people chose religion backlash atheist upbringing, way different. hand, many people choose religion way conforming expectations others. whole, cant conclude much whether atheism religion backlash conformism although general, people tendency go along group rather act think independently. how atheists differ religious people believe god. thats it. atheists may listen heavy metal  backwards, even  may prefer verdi requiem, even know words. may wear hawaiian shirts, may dress black, may even wear orange robes. many buddhists lack belief sort god. atheists even carry copy bible around  arguing against, course whoever are, chances met several atheists without realising it. atheists usually unexceptional behaviour appearance. unexceptional atheists less moral religious people depends. define morality obedience god, course atheists less moral obey god. usually one talks morality, one talks acceptable right unacceptable wrong behaviour within society. humans social animals, maximally successful must cooperate other. good enough reason discourage atheists antisocial immoral behaviour, purely purposes selfpreservation. many atheists behave moral compassionate way simply feel natural tendency empathize humans. care happens others know, simply way. naturally, people behave immorally try use atheism justify actions. however, equally many people behave immorally try use religious beliefs justify actions. example here trustworthy saying deserves full acceptance jesus christ came world save sinners... reason, shown mercy me... jesus christ might display unlimited patience example would believe receive eternal life. king eternal, immortal, invisible, god, honor glory forever ever. quote statement made court february 17th 1992 jeffrey dahmer, notorious cannibal serial killer milwaukee, wisconsin. seems every atheist massmurderer, religious massmurderer. trivial morality survey conducted roper organization found behavior deteriorated born again experiences. 4 respondents said driven intoxicated born again, 12 done conversion. similarly, 5 used illegal drugs conversion, 9 after. two percent admitted engaging illicit sex salvation 5 after. freethought today, september 1991, p. 12. seems best, religion monopoly moral behaviour. is thing atheist morality mean is thing morality atheists, answer yes, explained above. many atheists ideas morality least strong held religious people. mean does atheism characteristic moral code, answer no. atheism imply anything much person behave. atheists follow many moral rules theists, different reasons. atheists view morality something created humans, according way humans feel world ought work, rather seeing set rules decreed supernatural being. then atheists theists denying god study freedom religion foundation found 90 atheists responded became atheists religion work them. found religious beliefs fundamentally incompatible observed around them. atheists unbelievers ignorance denial unbelievers choice. vast majority spent time studying one religions, sometimes great depth. made careful considered decision reject religious beliefs. decision may, course, inevitable consequence individuals personality. naturally sceptical person, choice atheism often one makes sense, hence choice person honestly make. but atheists want believe god atheists live lives though nobody watching them. many desire watched over, matter goodnatured big brother figure might be. atheists would like able believe god  what one believe things merely one wants true risks approach obvious. atheists often decide wanting believe something enough must evidence belief. but course atheists see evidence existence god  unwilling souls see many, atheists previously religious. explained above, vast majority seriously considered possibility god exists. many atheists spent time prayer trying reach god. course, true atheists lack open mind assuming atheists biased insincere offensive closedminded. comments of course god there, looking properly likely viewed patronizing. certainly, wish engage philosophical debate atheists vital give benefit doubt assume sincere say searched god. willing believe basically telling truth, debate futile. isnt whole life completely pointless atheist many atheists live purposeful life. decide think gives meaning life, pursue goals. try make lives count, wishing eternal life, influence people live on. example, atheist may dedicate life political reform, hope leaving mark history. natural human tendency look meaning purpose random events. however, means obvious life sort thing meaning. put another way, everything looks like question actually sensible thing ask. atheists believe asking what meaning life silly asking what meaning cup coffee. believe life purpose meaning, is. so atheists find comfort time danger many ways obtaining comfort family, friends, even pets. less spiritual level, food drink tv. may sound rather empty vulnerable way face danger, what individuals believe things comforting, face reality matter harsh might be end, decision individual concerned. atheists unable believe something would otherwise believe merely makes feel comfortable. put truth comfort, consider searching truth sometimes makes feel unhappy, thats hard luck. dont atheists worry might suddenly shown wrong short answer no, you many atheists atheists years. encountered many arguments much supposed evidence existence god, found invalid inconclusive. thousands years religious belief resulted good proof existence god. atheists therefore tend feel unlikely proved wrong immediate future, stop worrying it. so theists question beliefs arguments apply no, beliefs questioned similar. weak atheism sceptical default position take asserts nothing. strong atheism negative belief. theism strong positive belief. atheists sometimes also argue theists question beliefs real harm cause  believers, everyone else. what sort harm religion represents huge financial work burden mankind. matter religious believers wasting money church buildings think time effort spent building churches, praying, on. imagine effort could better spent. many theists believe miracle healing. plenty instances ill people healed priest, ceasing take medicines prescribed doctors, dying result. theists died refused blood transfusions religious grounds. arguable catholic churchs opposition birth control  condoms particular  increasing problem overpopulation many thirdworld countries contributing spread aids worldwide. religious believers known murder children rather allow children become atheists marry someone different religion. those real believers. claimed believers sort excuse. makes real believer many one true religions hard tell. look christianity many competing groups, convinced true christians. sometimes even fight kill other. atheist supposed decide whos real christian isnt, even major christian churches like catholic church church england cant decide amongst themselves end, atheists take pragmatic view, decide anyone calls christian, uses christian belief dogma justify actions, considered christian. maybe christians perverting christian teaching ends  surely bible readily used support unchristian acts cant much moral code bible word god, made less easy misinterpret know beliefs perversion god intended single unambiguous interpretation bible, atheist take one interpretation another sayso sorry, someone claims believes jesus murdered others jesus bible told so, must call christian. obviously extreme sorts beliefs questioned. since nobody ever proved god exist, must unlikely basic religious beliefs, shared faiths, nonsense. hold, pointed start dialogue, positive assertions concerning existence entities inherently much harder disprove negative ones. nobody ever proved unicorns exist, make unlikely myths. therefore much valid hold negative assertion default hold positive assertion default. course, weak atheists would argue asserting nothing better still. well, atheisms great, many theists unfortunately, popularity belief little correct is, whether works consider many people believe astrology, graphology, pseudosciences. many atheists feel simply human weakness want believe gods. certainly many primitive human societies, religion allows people deal phenomena adequately understand. course, theres religion that. industrialized world, find people believing religious explanations phenomena even perfectly adequate natural explanations. religion may started means attempting explain world, nowadays serves purposes well. but many cultures developed religions. surely must say something really. religions superficially similar example, worth remembering religions buddhism taoism lack sort concept god christian sense. course, religions quick denounce competing religions, rather odd use one religion try justify another. what famous scientists philosophers concluded god exists every scientist philosopher believes god, one not. besides, already pointed out, truth belief determined many people believe it. also, important realize atheists view famous scientists philosophers way theists view religious leaders. famous scientist human may expert fields, talks matters words carry special weight. many respected scientists made look foolish speaking subjects lie outside fields expertise. so really saying widespread belief religion indicates nothing entirely.
